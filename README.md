The datasets used in the project are the following:

- **AirPassengers**: Which shows the evolution of the number of passengers of aircrafts during the middle of the 20th century.

In order to facilitate the use of the code located in this repository I've also provided the file `./darts-forecasting.yaml` which can be installed using the [Conda cheatsheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) after installing the [Anaconda navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
